We have 3 Program files namely

`Threshold.c` Here we performed thresholding for a given r*c matrix and an input file which is an image to get an output thresholding.

`Game_of_life.c` Here we implemented Game of life with initial configuration called seed and going till 55 generations.

`Matrix_Chain_Multiplication.c` Here we performed matrix chain multiplication and computed the speedup

The outputs were recorded in the below files namely:

`Threshold_result.txt` for `Threshold.c`
`Matrix_Chain_Multiplication_result.txt` for `Matrix_Chain_Multiplication.c`
`Game_of_life_result.txt` for `Game_of_life.c`

Later plots were drawn for:
1. Execution Time Vs Number of Threads 
    `Threshold_result_tvt.txt`
    `Matrix_Chain_Multiplication_tvt.txt`
    `Game_of_life_tvt.txt`
    `Threshold_thread_execution_4096.txt` means Execution time for matrix with r and c as 4096
    `Threshold_thread_execution_8192.txt` means Execution time for matrix with r and c as 8192
    `Threshold_thread_execution_16384.txt` means Execution time for matrix with r and c as 16384

2. Speedup Vs Number of Threads 
    `Threshold_result_tvs.txt`
    `Matrix_Chain_Multiplication_tvs.txt`
    `Game_of_life_tvs.txt`
    `Threshold_speedup_4096.txt` means Speedup calculation for matrix with r and c as 4096
    `Threshold_speedup_8192.txt` means Speedup calculation for matrix with r and c as 8192
    `Threshold_speedup_16384.txt` means Speedup calculation for matrix with r and c as 16384
