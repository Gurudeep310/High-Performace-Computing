We have 2 Program files namely
`merge_sort.c`  Here we implemented paralleization of merge sort for array size of "40000000" using threads varying from [1,16]. And avg time was recorded. 

`n_queens.c` Here we implemented parallelization on solving n_queen problem by varying threads and noting down the solution along with avg time.

The outputs were recorded in the below files namely:
`merge1.txt` for `merge_sort.c` for int datatype
`merge2.txt` for `merge_sort.c` for double datatype
`merge3.txt` for `merge_sort.c` for float datatype
`n_queens.txt` for `n_queens.c`
`N10.txt` for `n_queens.c` means chess board of size 10*10
`N12.txt` for `n_queens.c` means chess board of size 12*12
`N14.txt` for `n_queens.c` means chess board of size 14*14
`N16.txt` for `n_queens.c` means chess board of size 16*16

Later plots were drawn for the same:
`Q10.pdf`
`Q12.pdf`
`Q14.pdf`
`Q16.pdf`
`mergeInt.pdf`
`mergeFloat.jpeg`
`mergeDouble.jpeg`
