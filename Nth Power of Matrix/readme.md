We have 6 program files namely
`MatrixOP_1.c`  Where we were given a code file for matrix multiplication and we had to get the output for time elapsed by fixing the Runtime vs Threads by fixing the matrix size.

`MatrixOP_2.c` Where we were given a code file for matrix multiplication and we had to get the output for time elapsed by fixing the Runtime vs Matrix Size by fixing the number of threads.

`Matrix_Power_OMM.c` Here we implemented Ordinary Matrix Multiplication with varying matrix sizes,threads and power.

`Matrix_Power_OMM_Transpose.c` Here we implemented Transpose of matrix A and find nth power using Ordinary Matrix Multiplication with varying matrix sizes,threads and power.

`BMM_Matrix_Multiplication.c` Here we implemented Block Matrix Multiplication with varying matrix sizes,threads,power, block sizes.

`BMM_Matrix_Multiplication_Transpose.c` Here we implemented Transpose of matrix A and find nth power using Block Matrix Multiplication with varying matrix sizes,threads,power,block sizes.

The outputs were recorded in the below files namely:
`output_2_MatrixOP_1` for `MatrixOP_1.c`
`output_2_MatrixOP_2` for `MatrixOP_2.c`
`output_2_matrix_power_result_OMM` for `Matrix_Power_OMM.c`
`OMM_transpose_matrix_power_result` for `Matrix_Power_OMM_Transpose.c`
`OMM_matrix_power2_result` for `Matrix_Power_OMM.c`
`BMM_result` for `BMM_Matrix_Multiplication.c`
`Folder Named "BMM"` for `BMM_Matrix_Multiplication_Transpose.c`
